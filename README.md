•	Crafted a sophisticated machine learning model for forecasting customer purchasing intent, employed various pre-processing to convert categorical variables into bits, and performed feature scaling to improve machine learning performance. 
•	Introduced SMOTE to address dataset imbalance and segmented the data into 70% training and 30% testing. Avoided overfitting problems by removing outliers from training data. Eliminated unwanted features using recursive feature elimination. 
•	Trained diverse classification models by segmenting the dataset. Model performance assessment utilised a confusion matrix. Notably, the Random Forest algorithm outshone others, obtaining an impressive 89.3% accuracy with SelectKBest feature.
